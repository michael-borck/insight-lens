# SurveySavvy TODOs and Future Improvements

## Core Functionality
- [ ] Add database version tracking and schema migration support
- [ ] Implement more realistic time-based patterns (e.g., declining satisfaction during difficult course periods)
- [ ] Add support for different survey question sets (e.g., allow custom questions)
- [ ] Implement data validation and quality checks to ensure generated data meets statistical requirements
- [ ] Create more sophisticated sentiment correlation between questions (e.g., poor resources often correlate with poor support)

## Import/Export Options
- [ ] Add SQL dump export capability for moving data to other database systems
- [ ] Create PDF survey report import tool based on the reference import script
- [ ] Support exporting to Excel (.xlsx) format with formatting and pivot tables
- [ ] Add JSON export format for API integration
- [ ] Implement incremental export (changes only)

## CLI Enhancements
- [ ] Add interactive mode with wizard-style setup
- [ ] Add configuration file support to save frequently used settings
- [ ] Create analyze command to display statistics about generated database
- [ ] Add validation command to check database integrity

## API Improvements
- [ ] Create a REST API wrapper for remote data generation
- [ ] Add query API for extracting specific data subsets
- [ ] Develop a programmatic interface for integration with other systems

## Documentation and Examples
- [ ] Create Jupyter notebook examples showing data analysis use cases
- [ ] Add example SQL queries for common analytics scenarios
- [ ] Develop visualization examples with matplotlib/seaborn
- [ ] Provide comparison examples with real anonymized data

## Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Add integration tests with actual database generation
- [ ] Implement statistical validation tests to ensure realistic distributions
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting
- [ ] Create benchmark tests for performance optimization

## Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement batch database operations for faster generation
- [ ] Add multithreading support for parallel data generation
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for very large datasets
- [ ] Implement incremental generation to add data to existing databases

## Miscellaneous
- [ ] Create Docker container for easy deployment
- [ ] Add support for other database backends (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- [ ] Implement a simple browser-based visualization dashboard (optional)
- [ ] Create a minimal TUI (Text User Interface) for systems without graphical capabilities

## Compatibility and Deployment
- [ ] Ensure Python 3.12+ compatibility
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Package and publish to PyPI
- [ ] Create pre-built binary distributions for non-Python users
