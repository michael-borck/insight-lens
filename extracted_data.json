It really did feel like he cared about my learning and while I did struggle with this class and may have to repeat it there are worse classes to repeat.",

      "comment_text": "Ihave rated the support of my learning and the assessments within the unit particularly low as I feel strongly about these within the unit. Within the tutorials, I felt the tutor did not understand the material or tasks proficiently. As such, I felt my learning was impacted, as I often found myself confused, and when I sought help, I was left in the same manner. Additionally, my biggest complaint would be regarding the final assessment. I don't quite understand the reasoning behind a 24\u2013hour assessment, requiring the amount of work consistent with an assignment that typically spans over a few weeks. From what I gather, during one of the lectures, Michael Borck mentioned that a reason for the time frame was that students who pay for their assessments to be completed within a 24\u2013hour timeframe is the most costly option possible. I find this timeframe to be unreasonable and the reasoning behind it unbelievable. This is unfair to students like myself who do not engage in such services. To complete this assessment, I personally had to work overnight from the release time until the early hours of the following day. I have never had a unit whose assessment impacted my personal health and well\u2013being. At the very least, if this continues, I urge the unit coordinator to at least lighten the workload for future students so that their health is not affected.",
