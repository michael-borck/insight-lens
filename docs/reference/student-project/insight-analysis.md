**Project Title:** Identifying High-Performing Colleagues Through Insight-Survey Data Analysis

**Introduction:**
This proposal outlines a project to analyse Insight-Survey data, which includes both numerical scores and open-ended responses, to identify colleagues who have excelled in their Insight Scores. The study will use the BIS Discipline as a test case to assess the effectiveness of this analysis. This initiative aims to recognise high performers while ensuring inclusivity, fairness, and data privacy.

**Objectives:**
1. Analyse survey results to identify colleagues who have performed exceptionally well while maintaining anonymity.
2. Develop a systematic approach to interpreting both numerical and qualitative survey data.
3. Provide recommendations on how these insights can be used for recognition and continuous improvement.
4. Seek ethics approval to ensure compliance with institutional and professional ethical standards.

**Methodology:**
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Obtain Insight-Survey data, ensuring confidentiality and ethical handling of information.
   - Anonymise survey data to remove personally identifiable information (PII).
   - Consider using synthetic (fake) data where necessary to maintain privacy.
   - Submit ethics approval application prior to data collection and analysis.
   
2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Use statistical methods to assess numerical scores and identify trends.
   - Apply text analysis techniques to open-ended responses while ensuring anonymity.
   - Explore the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms for pattern recognition while maintaining ethical data use.
   
3. **Interpretation & Reporting:**
   - Identify general trends rather than specific individuals to uphold privacy.
   - Ensure inclusivity by considering factors such as consistency of performance and feedback patterns.
   - Summarise findings in a report, highlighting key insights and actionable recommendations.

**Privacy Considerations:**
- Anonymisation techniques will be applied to protect staff identities.
- Open-ended responses will be reviewed for identifiable information and processed accordingly.
- Use of Generative AI will be considered only if it enhances data anonymisation and insight generation without compromising ethical considerations.

**Timeline:**
- **Month 1:** Ethics approval submission, data collection, anonymisation, and initial processing.
- **Month 2:** Data analysis, interpretation, and theme identification.
- **Month 3:** Report writing, review, and presentation of findings.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- A structured approach to analysing Insight-Survey results while preserving privacy.
- Identification of high-performing colleagues through anonymised data analysis.
- Insights on how the BIS Discipline can use survey results to foster continuous improvement.

**Conclusion:**
This project will serve as a valuable case study in leveraging survey data for meaningful insights while addressing privacy concerns. The findings can guide future recognition initiatives and inform best practices for interpreting Insight-Survey results across different disciplines.
