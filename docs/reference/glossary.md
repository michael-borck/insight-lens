## E

**Export**
The process of saving charts, data, or reports from InsightLens in external file formats.

**Extraction**
The process of pulling data from PDF survey reports and converting it into structured database records.

## F

**Filter**
A tool to narrow down data analysis to specific subsets (e.g., by time period, unit type, or performance level).

**Forecast**
A prediction of future trends based on historical survey data patterns.

## G

**Gatekeeper**
macOS security feature that may initially block InsightLens from running as an unsigned application.

## H

**Hover Tooltip**

## I

**Import**
The process of loading survey data from external files (PDF or CSV) into InsightLens.

**Institutional Survey**
Standardized survey administered by a university to collect student feedback on units.

## L

**Likert Scale**
A rating scale typically used in surveys (e.g., 1-5 where 1=Strongly Disagree, 5=Strongly Agree).

**Local AI**
AI models that run on your computer rather than cloud services, providing privacy and offline capabilities.

## M

**Metadata**
Information about the survey data itself, such as import dates, file sources, and processing details.

**Multi-semester Analysis**
Comparison of unit performance across multiple teaching periods.

## N

**Natural Language Query**
Asking questions about your data using normal spoken language rather than technical commands.

**Negative Sentiment**
Student comments classified as expressing dissatisfaction, criticism, or concerns.

## O

**OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**
Technology that converts scanned images of text into editable text data.

**Ollama**
Software that enables running AI models locally on your computer for privacy and offline use.

**Overall Satisfaction**
A summary measure of student satisfaction with their unit experience, often the primary survey metric.

## P

**PDF Processing**
The extraction of survey data from PDF report files into structured database format.

**Positive Sentiment**
Student comments classified as expressing satisfaction, praise, or positive experiences.

**Postgraduate**
University courses at master's or doctoral level, typically requiring prior undergraduate study.

## Q

**Query**
A request for specific information from the database, either through filters or AI assistant questions.

**Quick Insights**
Automated analysis features that highlight trending units and areas needing attention.

## R

**Response Rate**
The percentage of enrolled students who completed the unit survey (e.g., 45 responses from 100 students = 45% response rate).

**Real-time Analysis**
Analysis that updates automatically as new data is imported or filters are changed.

## S

**Semester**
An academic term, typically lasting 12-16 weeks (some institutions use trimesters or quarters).

**Sentiment Analysis**
Automated classification of student comments as positive, negative, or neutral.

**Sentiment Score**
A numerical rating (-1 to +1) indicating how positive or negative a comment is.

**SQLite**
The database technology used by InsightLens to store survey data locally on your computer.

**Stakeholder**
Anyone with an interest in survey results (lecturers, coordinators, deans, students).

## T

**Temporal Trends**
Changes in survey metrics over time (semester-to-semester, year-over-year).

**Threshold**
A boundary value used for filtering or alerting (e.g., "units with satisfaction below 3.0").

**Trend Analysis**
Examination of how survey metrics change over time to identify patterns and trajectories.

## U

**Undergraduate**
University courses at bachelor's degree level, typically the first tertiary qualification.

**Unit**
A single subject or course within a university program (also called "subject," "course," or "module").

**Unit Code**
The unique identifier for a unit (e.g., ISYS2001, MATH1001).

**Unit Coordinator**
The academic staff member responsible for overall unit management and quality.

**Unit Offering**
A specific instance of a unit taught in a particular semester, year, and location.

## V
